# Onion Scrape

## Current Limitations:
* A new scrape appends articles to the bottom of the list. I want to drop the collection first and then display a new scrape of articles, rather than add to the old list
* Does not display all comments - only the most current
* Delete button is not fully functioning

Experience here: [Onion Scrape](https://murmuring-sands-38119.herokuapp.com/)
